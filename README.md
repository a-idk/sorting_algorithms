# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project dwells on to main subjects, that is , the sorting algorithm and the Big O

## Project Description

- The tasks and excercises in this project are focused on the understanding of these concepts:
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
